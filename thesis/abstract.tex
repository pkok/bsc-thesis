This thesis presents a method for limiting the movement of non-prismatic robotic limbs, such that a point on the limb remains in a certain plane relative to another non-prismatic limb, while both limbs may move.  As an example of practical use, a partial telepresence system is presented, which will convey tactile information of the environment of the robot's hands to its human operator.

The robot used is an Aldebaran Nao robot with a Hokuyo URG-04LX Scanning Laser Rangefinder mounted on its head.  The operator controls each arm by moving an object, which tracks its position relative to a predefined infrared beacon.  A tactile model of the environment for both hands is made by the rangefinder, and presented to the user by vibrating the controller object on collision danger.  Because of the kinematic limitations of the robot's 3D scanner, a method for keeping its hands in the rangefinder's scanning area is presented as well.
